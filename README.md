A tribute to one of my favourite show Silicon Valley, It's a hot dod not hot dog classier written in swift UI.

#### Let's Get started.

### First we collect some data.
 - Download images via google, bing, or anywhere you want *there are tons of scraping scripts**
   - Images I used to tranin the model:
      - Hot Dogs
      - Not Hot Dogs

### Then we quicky filter over all the data and see if there are any noise.
  - I just glanced over and saw if everything looked ok. 
  - Just zoom out and see if there are blank images and or "noise images".
  
### Then we train (choo choo!)
